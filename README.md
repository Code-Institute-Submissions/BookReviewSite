# BookClub - Book Review Website | Third Milestone Project
**Stream Three Project: Data Centric Development - Code Institute**
## Introduction
This is my third project showcasing the knowledge I have gained in Python3, Databases such as MongoDB and Frameworks like Flask. I believe I have 
created a user friendly website 
I have built a simple CRUD application that a user is able to interact with and perform all the basic create, read, update and delete functions.
Users can create accounts, add books, review books, edit account info, upload user images, delete books etc!
